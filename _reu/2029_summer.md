# University of Minnesota REU: Summer 2029 â€” Hyperparameter Tuning and Catastrophe Theory

> ðŸš§ This page is under construction. Dates, funding details, and application information are to be determined.

**We aim to rigorously analyze the role of randomness in hyperparameter search via techniques from singularity theory.**

## Program Overview

The **University of Minnesota REU on Hyperparameter Tuning and Catastrophe Theory** is a planned six-week undergraduate research program for **Summer 2029**. The program will focus on:

- The mathematical structure behind **hyperparameter optimization** in machine learning.
- The use of **singularity theory** to model and understand **catastrophic changes** in performance landscapes.
- Investigating the **role of randomness** and bifurcation phenomena in tuning processes.

Participants will work closely with faculty and graduate mentors in an interactive and rigorous research environment, with access to dedicated resources at the **School of Mathematics**.

## Program Benefits

- **Stipend**: *To be determined*  
- **Travel and Living Support**:  
  - *Travel reimbursement*: Up to a fixed amount (*TBD*) for non-local participants.  
  - *Housing and meals*: Provided for non-local participants (*TBD*).  

## Eligibility

Open to undergraduate students who:  
- Are pursuing an associate or bachelorâ€™s degree.  
- Are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or U.S. nationals.  

## Application Deadline

*To be announced.*

## Applicant Requirements

Ideal applicants should have:  
- Familiarity with **basic calculus and linear algebra**.  
- Programming experience in **Python**.  
- (Preferred) Exposure to **machine learning** or **dynamical systems**.  

## Required Documents

- A **Statement of Interest**  
- One **reference letter** (submitted online)  
- An **unofficial transcript**
