## Course Description and Objectives

This course introduces the fundamental concepts and techniques of linear algebra, with an emphasis on both theory and applications. By the end of the course, students should be able to:

1. Understand and apply the core theory of linear algebra, including:
   - Systems of linear equations  
   - Matrices and determinants  
   - Euclidean vector spaces and general vector spaces  
   - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors  
   - Inner products and orthogonality  
   - Diagonalization of quadratic forms  
   - Linear transformations between vector spaces
2. Gain exposure to basic ideas from numerical linear algebra and computational methods.
3. Apply linear algebra concepts to problems arising in other fields, including data science and related disciplines.

## Assessments and Grading

### Homework
- **Frequency:** Weekly  
- **Submission:** Via Gradescope  
- **Grading:** Only a subset of problems from each assignment will be graded.  
- **Policy:** The lowest homework score will be dropped.  
- **Late Homework:** Accepted only under the most compelling circumstances and with prior approval.

### Exams
- **Midterm Exams:** Two in-class midterm exams  
- **Final Exam:** Comprehensive

### Grading Breakdown
- Homework: **30%**  
- Midterm Exam 1: **20%**  
- Midterm Exam 2: **20%**  
- Final Exam: **30%**

After the final exam, **two overall scores** will be calculated:

- **Score 1:**  
  Homework (15%) + Midterm 1 (25%) + Midterm 2 (25%) + Final Exam (35%)

- **Score 2:**  
  Homework (15%) + max(Midterm 1, Midterm 2) (35%) + Final Exam (50%)

Your final numerical score will be the **higher of Score 1 and Score 2**.

## Letter Grades

Your letter grade will be determined using the more favorable of the following two schemes.

### Grade Scheme 1 (Fixed Scale)
- 90–100: A  
- 80–89: B  
- 65–79: C  
- 50–64: D  
- Below 50: F  

### Grade Scheme 2 (Approximate Curve)
- Top 35%: A  
- Next 35%: B  
- Next 25%: C  
- Remaining 5%: D and F  

Plus/minus grades (A–, B+, B–, C+, C–, D+, D–) may be assigned. For example, “A” includes both A and A–, “B” includes B+, B, and B–, etc.

## Exam Policies

### Make-up Exams
- Make-up exams are **generally not permitted**.  
- Missing a midterm is allowed only for the most compelling reasons.  
- In extraordinary circumstances, prior permission must be obtained from the **lecturer (not the TA)**.  
- Failure to obtain permission will result in a score of **0**.  
- Missing the final exam, except in extremely exceptional cases, may result in **failure of the course**.

### Calculator and Cheat Sheet Policy
- **Calculators:** Not required and **not permitted** during exams.  
- **Cheat Sheet:** One handwritten **A4 sheet (both sides)** is allowed for each exam.
