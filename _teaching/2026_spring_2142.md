## Course Description and Objectives


This course has three primary objectives. (1) To present the basic theory of linear algebra, including: solving systems of linear equations; determinants; the theory of Euclidean vector spaces and general vector spaces; eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices; inner products; diagonalization of quadratic forms; and linear transformations between vector spaces. (2) To introduce certain aspects of numerical linear algebra and computation. (3) To introduce applications of linear algebra to other domains such as data science.

## Assessments and Grading

### Homework
- **Frequency:** Weekly  
- **Submission:** Via Canvas  
- **Grading:** A subset of problems from each assignment will be graded.  
- **Policy:** Your lowest homework score will be dropped.  
- **Late Homework:** Accepted only under the most compelling circumstances.

### Exams
- **Midterm Exams:** Two in-class midterms  
- **Final Exam:** Comprehensive

### Grading Breakdown
- Homework: **30%**  
- Midterm Exam 1: **20%**  
- Midterm Exam 2: **20%**  
- Final Exam: **30%**

After the final exam, **two overall scores** will be computed:
- **Score 1:**  
  Homework (15%) + Midterm 1 (25%) + Midterm 2 (25%) + Final Exam (35%)
- **Score 2:**  
  Homework (15%) + max(Midterm 1, Midterm 2) (35%) + Final Exam (50%)

Your final numerical score is the **maximum of Score 1 and Score 2**.

### Letter Grades

Your letter grade will be assigned as the higher of the following two schemes:

**Grade Scheme 1 (Fixed Scale):**
- 90–100: A  
- 80–89: B  
- 65–79: C  
- 50–64: D  
- Below 50: F

**Grade Scheme 2 (Approximate Curve):**
- Top 35%: A
- Next 35%: B  
- Next 25%: C  
- Remaining 5%: D and F  

Plus/minus grades (A–, B+, B–, C+, C–, D+, D–) may be assigned, and A includes A and A-, B includes B+, B, B-, etc.
