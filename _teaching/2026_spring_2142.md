## Course Description and Objectives

This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts and methods of linear algebra, with attention to both theoretical foundations and practical applications. Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

1. Understand and apply the core ideas of linear algebra, including:
   - Systems of linear equations  
   - Matrices and determinants  
   - Euclidean vector spaces and abstract vector spaces  
   - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors  
   - Inner products and orthogonality  
   - Diagonalization of quadratic forms  
   - Linear transformations between vector spaces
2. Develop familiarity with basic techniques from numerical linear algebra and computation.
3. Apply linear algebra tools to problems arising in other disciplines, including data science and related fields.

---

## Prerequisites

- **MATH 1272** (or equivalent), with a grade of **C– or higher**

---

## Weekly Course Outline

A detailed week-by-week outline of topics and assignments will be posted on Canvas.

---

## Lecture Notes

The instructor uses handwritten lecture notes. Due to accessibility requirements, no digital version is available. Students may borrow a physical copy from the instructor upon request.

---

## Assessments and Grading

### Homework
- **Frequency:** Weekly  
- **Submission:** Via Gradescope  
- **Grading:** Only a subset of problems from each assignment will be graded.  
- **Policy:** The lowest **two** homework scores will be dropped.  
- **Late Homework:** Accepted only under the most compelling circumstances and with prior approval.

### Exams
- **Midterm Exam 1:** Thursday, February 19 (administered during discussion sections)  
- **Midterm Exam 2:** Thursday, April 2 (administered during discussion sections)  
- **Final Exam:** Thursday, May 7, 2026, 12:00–3:00 PM, Location: TBD

### Grading Scheme

After the final exam, **two overall scores** will be computed:

- **Score 1:**  
  Homework (15%) + Midterm 1 (25%) + Midterm 2 (25%) + Final Exam (35%)

- **Score 2:**  
  Homework (15%) + max(Midterm 1, Midterm 2) (35%) + Final Exam (50%)

Your final numerical score will be the **higher of Score 1 and Score 2**.

---

## Letter Grades

Your final letter grade will be determined using the more favorable of the following two grading schemes.

### Grade Scheme 1 (Fixed Scale)
- 90–100: A  
- 80–89: B  
- 65–79: C  
- 50–64: D  
- Below 50: F  

### Grade Scheme 2 (Approximate Curve)
- Top 35%: A  
- Next 35%: B  
- Next 25%: C  
- Remaining 5%: D and F  

Plus/minus grades (A–, B+, B–, C+, C–, D+, D–) may be assigned. For example, “A” includes A and A–, while “B” includes B+, B, and B–.

## Exam Policies

### Make-up Exams
- Make-up exams are **generally not permitted**.  
- Missing a midterm is allowed only under the most compelling circumstances.  
- In extraordinary cases, prior approval must be obtained from the lecturer or the TA.  
- Missing the final exam, except in extremely exceptional cases, may result in **failure of the course**.

### Calculator and Cheat Sheet Policy
- **Calculators:** Not required and **not permitted** during exams.  
- **Cheat Sheet:** One handwritten **A4 sheet (both sides)** is permitted for each exam.
