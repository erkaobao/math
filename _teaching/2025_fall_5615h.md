## Course Description

This course offers a rigorous introduction to real analysis with a strong emphasis on proof-based understanding of foundational concepts. We begin with the construction and properties of the natural, rational, and real number systems, including the completeness axiom and the extended real numbers. We then study sequences and series of real numbers, convergence criteria, and related topological concepts in metric spaces. Topics include monotone and Cauchy sequences, subsequences, limsup/liminf, and convergence tests for series.

Next, we develop the theory of continuous functions, uniform continuity, and limits of functions in metric spaces, including connectedness. The course proceeds to power series, uniform convergence of sequences and series of functions, and applications such as term-by-term differentiation and integration. We conclude with a rigorous treatment of differentiation and Taylor’s theorem, the Riemann integral and its generalizations, improper integrals, and selected advanced topics such as nowhere-differentiable functions.

## Assessments

### Homework
- **Frequency:** Weekly on Canvas  
- **Submission:** Via Canvas  
- **Evaluation:** A few problems from each problem set will be graded. Your lowest problem set score will be dropped.  
- **Late Homework:** Accepted only for the most compelling reasons.

### In-Class Midterm Exams
- **Duration:** 1 hour 55 minutes  
- **Midterm 1:** October 1, 2025 (during regular class time, in class)  
- **Midterm 2:** November 5, 2025 (during regular class time, in class)

### Final Exam
- **Duration:** 3 hours  
- **Date & Time:** Friday, December 12, 2025 — 12:00 PM – 3:00 PM  
- **Location:** TBA (Common Math Final)

### Make-up Exams
- Make-up exams are generally not allowed.
- Missing a midterm is permitted only for the most compelling reasons.
- In extraordinary situations, obtain permission from the lecturer (not your TA) in advance; otherwise, a score of 0 will be recorded.
- In extremely exceptional cases, missing the final exam will result in failure of the course.

## Grading Policy

- Homework: 30%  
- Each Midterm: 20%  
- Final Exam: 30%

After the final exam, two scores are computed:

- **Score 1:** Homework (30%) + Midterm 1 (20%) + Midterm 2 (20%) + Final Exam (30%)  
- **Score 2:** Homework (30%) + max(Midterm 1, Midterm 2) (30%) + Final Exam (40%)

Your final score is max(Score 1, Score 2).  
Your letter grade is assigned as the _higher_ of:

- **Grade 1 (fixed scale out of 100):**  
  - 90: A  
  - 80: B  
  - 65: C  
  - 50: D  

- **Grade 2 (approximate curve):**  
  - Top 25%: A  
  - Next 30%: B  
  - Next 35%: C  
  - Remaining 10%: D and F  

Letter grades may also include A-, B+, B-, C+, C-, D+, D-.

## Calculator Policy
- Calculators are not required and will not be permitted during exams.
