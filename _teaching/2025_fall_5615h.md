## Course Description

This course provides a rigorous introduction to real analysis, emphasizing proof-based understanding of fundamental concepts. We begin with the construction and properties of the natural, rational, and real number systems, including the completeness axiom and extended real numbers. We then study sequences and series of real numbers, convergence criteria, and related topological concepts in metric spaces. Topics include monotone and Cauchy sequences, subsequences, limsup/liminf, and convergence tests for series.

We next develop the theory of continuous functions, uniform continuity, and limits of functions in metric spaces, including connectedness. The course then covers power series, uniform convergence of sequences and series of functions, and applications such as term-by-term differentiation and integration. We conclude with a rigorous treatment of differentiation and Taylor’s theorem, the Riemann integral and its generalizations, improper integrals, and selected advanced topics such as nowhere-differentiable functions.

**Prerequisites:** \[\[2243 or 2373\], \[2263 or 2374\], \[2283 or 3283\]\] or 2574.  
**Enrollment Requirements:** Math honors students; 5000-level courses.
