For the lab, you need mathematics. You can obtain it from [here](https://cse.umn.edu/cseit/software)

## Using Mathematica Notebooks

### Opening a Notebook:
1. Use **Open** under the File menu.
2. Select `Lab 0.nb` from the list and click **OK**.
3. Alternatively, choose **New** from the File menu to open another notebook for typing commands.

**Important**: Mathematica is **syntax sensitive**. If you encounter errors, double-check capitals and parentheses.

### Saving a Notebook:
- Save notebooks **without output** to avoid using excessive disk space:
  1. Select **Delete All Output** from the Kernel menu.
  2. Use **Save As** under the File menu to save the notebook.

**Note**: You can restore outputs by selecting **Evaluate Notebook** from the Kernel menu.
