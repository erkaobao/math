# LGBTQIA+ in Mathematics at UMN

Welcome to our webpage dedicated to celebrating LGBTQIA+ individuals in the field of mathematics!

## About Us

We are a community of mathematicians and allies who support diversity, inclusion, and representation within the mathematical sciences. Our goal is to highlight the contributions of LGBTQIA+ mathematicians, provide resources for LGBTQIA+ individuals in mathematics, and foster a supportive environment for all.

## LGBTQIA+ Mathematicians

### [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)

- **Contributions:** Turing is widely considered the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma code during World War II, which significantly contributed to the Allied victory.
- **Identity:** Turing was a gay man and was persecuted for his sexual orientation in the UK. His tragic story underscores the importance of LGBTQIA+ rights and acceptance.

### [Sylvia Rivera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Rivera)

- **Contributions:** Rivera was a transgender activist and a prominent figure in the LGBTQIA+ rights movement. While not a mathematician by profession, her advocacy work paved the way for greater acceptance and visibility of transgender individuals.
- **Legacy:** Rivera's bravery and activism inspire us to create a more inclusive and equitable mathematical community.

### [Gian-Carlo Rota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian-Carlo_Rota)

- **Contributions:** Rota was a mathematician known for his work in combinatorics and mathematical logic. He made significant contributions to the understanding of partially ordered sets and the theory of incidence algebras.
- **Identity:** Rota was openly gay and faced discrimination during his career. Despite this, he made lasting contributions to mathematics and inspired many with his passion for the subject.

### [Mariette DiChristina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariette_DiChristina)

- **Contributions:** DiChristina is a mathematician and editor-in-chief of *Scientific American*, a prominent science magazine. She has worked to promote scientific literacy and communication.
- **Identity:** DiChristina is an openly lesbian woman and advocates for LGBTQIA+ representation in STEM fields.
