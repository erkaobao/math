# Math 8365: Manifold and Topology

### Time

10:10 AM - 11:00 AM MWF

### Location

Vincent Hall 20

### Office

Vincent Hall 365

### Zoom Meeting ID

[973 584 3950](https://umn.zoom.us/j/9735843950)

### Office hours

tbd, or by appointment

### Textbooks

I will follow: **Differential Geometry: Bundles, Connections, Metrics and Curvature by Clifford Taubes**.
I will also reference the book: **Differential Geometry: Connections, Curvature, and
Characteristic Classes by L. W. Tu**


### Contents

Riemannian metric, tensors, vector bundles, connections and curvature
on a vector bundle, the Levi-Civita connection. The positivity of
curvature and the topology of a manifold. Geodesics, Lie derivative,
the exponential map, completeness. Characteristic classes, the
Chern-Weil theory. Bianchi identities, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
Introduction to Lie groups.

A detailed day by day plan can be found on [Canvas](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/483935/pages/course-content).

### Prerequisites

Knowledge of basic point-set topology and multivariate calculus will be essential for this course.

### Homework

Homework will be assigned on weekly on [Canvas](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/356310).
Collaboration on homework is encouraged.

### Exams

There are one midterm exam and one final exam. Both exams are take home exams. No collaboration is allowed. You can use books or notes, but you are not allowed to use internet for the exams.
