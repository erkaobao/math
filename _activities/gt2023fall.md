## Abstracts

- Christopher Kuo

  - Perverse sheaves are topological invariants that classify objects from several different fields. For example, they are equivalent to regular holonomic D-modules on the same complex manifold and holomorphic Lagrangians in infinitesimal Fukaya category of its cotangent bundle. In this talk, I will discuss a joint work with Côté, Nadler and Shende, where we perform a construction on complex contact manifolds, globalizing the previously defined perverse microsheaves on coprojective bundles.
