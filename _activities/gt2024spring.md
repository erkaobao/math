## Abstracts

- Joseph Breen

  - A fundamental result in 3-dimensional contact topology is the Giroux correspondence between contact structures and open book decompositions. Until recently, the techniques that Giroux used in dimension 3 were not available in higher dimensions; indeed, for reasons I will discuss, contact topology is much more tractable in dimension 3. However, there have been several efforts to improve the situation. In this talk, I will describe joint work with Ko Honda and Yang Huang on extending the Giroux correspondence and its underlying techniques to all dimensions.

- Ko Honda (Tuesday talk)

  - Hecke algebras are ubiquitous in number theory and geometric representation theory. In this talk we describe the appearance of various Hecke algebras such as the affine Hecke algebra and the double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) in Floer theory, through the higher-dimensional analog of Heegaard Floer homology. This is joint work with Yin Tian and Tianyu Yuan.  (This talk is independent of Talks #2.)

- Ko Honda (Friday talk)

  - Around twenty years ago Emmanuel Giroux formulated the equivalence of contact structures and open book decompositions with Weinstein pages up to stabilization. We establish the Giroux correspondence in full generality using the recent developments in convex hypersurface theory, described in the second talk.  Time permitting, we also explain their relationship with Lefschetz fibrations for Weinstein domains.  This is joint work with Joe Breen and Yang Huang. (This talk is independent of Talks #1.)

- Hao Zhuang

  - In this talk, we will first introduce an invariant Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex for closed $T^l$-manifolds with a special type of $T^l$-invariant Morse-Bott functions. Then, we will establish a chain complex isomorphism between our $T^l$-invariant Morse-Bott-Smale complex and the Witten instanton complex. Finally, if time permits, we will mention the estimates of eigenvalues of the Witten Laplacian, which motivates one of our ongoing projects. 

- Roman Krutowski
  
  - I will define Heegaard Floer symplectic cohomology (HFSH), a novel invariant which serves as a closed string analog of the higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology. One may view it as a Floer invariant associated with a problem of Hamiltonian motion of multiple identical particles. This invariant can also be regarded as a deformation of a k-th symmetric version of symplectic cohomology, given by counting curves of higher genus. 
I will also introduce a multiloop Morse complex of a manifold, which is a Morse-theoretic counterpart of HFSH. At last, I will show that HFSH of a cotangent bundle T^*M is isomorphic to the cohomology of the multiloop complex of M. This result generalizes Viterbo's isomorphism theorem to the setting of multiple particles.

- Khanh Le
  - Arithmetic subgroups of PSL(2,C) provide a large class of hyperbolic 3-manifolds exhibiting a lot of interactions between geometry, topology and number theory. In this talk, I will give examples of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds in dimension 2 and 3 with the goal to illustrate the connections between geometrical, topological and number theoretical aspects of these manifolds. I will discuss various invariants and techniques that are useful in distinguishing arithmetic and non-arithmetic manifolds. Finally, I will discuss some observations related to the question of arithmeticity of modular knots.
