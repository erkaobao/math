## Abstracts

- Joseph Breen

  - A fundamental result in 3-dimensional contact topology is the Giroux correspondence between contact structures and open book decompositions. Until recently, the techniques that Giroux used in dimension 3 were not available in higher dimensions; indeed, for reasons I will discuss, contact topology is much more tractable in dimension 3. However, there have been several efforts to improve the situation. In this talk, I will describe joint work with Ko Honda and Yang Huang on extending the Giroux correspondence and its underlying techniques to all dimensions.
