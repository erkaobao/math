## Abstracts

- Xiaolong Li

  - The second kind of curvature operator has received recent attention following the resolution of Nishikawa's conjecture by Cao-Gursky-Tran, Nienhaus-Petersen-Wink, and myself. These works have shown that a closed Riemannian manifold with 3-nonnegative curvature operator of the second kind is either flat or diffeomorphic to a spherical space form. In this talk, I will briefly introduce the curvature operator of the second kind and talk about the proof of Nishikawa's conjecture. Then I will talk about my recent work on new sphere theorems under negative lower bounds of the curvature operator of the second kind.

- Rohil Prasad

  - Punctured holomorphic curves have been a key tool in symplectic topology and dynamics since their introduction by Hofer in 1993. I'll describe a new compactness theorem for sequences of punctured holomorphic curves with actions converging to 0 and with bounded topology, without the traditional assumption of bounded Hofer energy. In the limit, one obtains a family of compact invariant subsets of the underlying Hamiltonian flow. Such sequences turn out to be abundant in low-dimensional symplectic dynamics. Dynamical applications include (1) a generalization of the Le Calvez-Yoccoz theorem to higher-genus surfaces and three-manifolds and (2) a generalization of a recent theorem by Fish-Hofer on four-dimensional autonomous Hamiltonian flows. This talk is based on arXiv preprints 2401.14445 (joint with Dan Cristofaro-Gardiner) and 2405.01106.
