## Abstracts

- Julian Chaidez

  - Pseudo-Anosov flows, originally introduced by Thurston, are a broad class of hyperbolic flows on 3-manifolds that are Anosov except along a finite link of singular closed orbits. A longstanding conjecture states that any 3-manifold carries only finitely many transitive pseudo-Anosov flows, up to the appropriate type of equivalence. In this talk, I will explain a proof of this conjecture for a large class of pseudo-Anosov flows that are Reeb, in the appropriate sense. This extends recent work by Barthelme-Bowedn-Mann for Reeb Anosov flows. The proof involves a computation of cylindrical contact homology in this setting. This is joint work in preparation with Yijie Pan (USC).

  - I will present a new theorem proving convergence of normal form series for a broad range of Lie pseudo-group actions on submanifolds.  This result generalizes the normal forms of Chern and Moser for hypersurfaces in CR geometry.  The proof relies on combining the theory of involutive systems of partial differential equations with the method of equivariant moving frames.  Joint work with Francis Valiquette and Masoud Sabzevari.

  - In 1970, N. Tanaka gave a method for assigning a canonical frame to distribution with a constant Tanaka symbol. In 2009, B. Doubrov and I. Zelenko utilized a symplectification procedure to obtain a canonical frame for distributions independent of their Tanaka symbol, but an additional condition called "maximality of class" was required of the distribution. In a work with I. Zelenko, we recently proved that all rank 2 distributions with 5-dimensional cube are of maximal class at a generic point; this allowed us to assign a canonical frame at a generic point to every rank 2 distribution which is not Goursat. In the rank 2 case, I will give an interpretation of the symplectification procedure in terms of a classical construction called Cartan prolongation. Time permitting, I will also sketch what is known about a collection of fundamental invariants called harmonic invariants in the case of rank 2 distributions in dimensions 6 and 7 along with differential relations called syzygies satisfied by these invariants.
